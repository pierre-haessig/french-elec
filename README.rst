About the data
==============

Data is available as 15 minutes averages. 
The richness of the content increases over time :

* starting June 24th, 2000, *consumption* + *D-1 forecast* is available
* starting July 8th, 2010, production data is also available
  (detailed by production means : nuclear, hydro, wind, ...)

*Note* : RTE does't guarantee this data to be accurate.
It is provided for "informative" purpose only.
